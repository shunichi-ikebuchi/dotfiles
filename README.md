# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install chezmoi
brew install chezmoi

# Apply dotfiles
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/shunichi-ikebuchi/dotfiles.git
```

## Acknowledgments

This dotfiles setup is powered by amazing open source tools:

**[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)** - The perfect dotfiles manager. Makes it incredibly easy to manage configurations across multiple machines with templating, encryption, and version control. Huge thanks to the chezmoi community.

Thank you to all the open source developers who make these tools possible.
